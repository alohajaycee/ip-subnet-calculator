# Free Online IP Address Subnet Calculator
### History
This was a project I made back in college to help me understand how to manually calculate ip addresses in my networking class. I broke down each process and made it into a program. Eventually, this made me understand the manual process much better. 

This was originally coded in PHP but now been ported to JavaScript and can now be used for free.
